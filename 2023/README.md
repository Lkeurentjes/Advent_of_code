# Advent of Code 2023
Advent of code 2023 solutions in python, using various algorithms.

## Kind of problems versus used algorithms

- day 1 - calibration
    - For part 1 you need to find the first and last digit in a line and combine those, to get the sum of all lines.
    - For part 2 the digit can also be written in txt fromat, so with a little help form a dictionary I do the same.
- day 2 - color cubes
    - For part 1 you need to find out which games can be played with a set number of cubes and sum their id's
    - For part 2 you need to get the minimum numbers of cubes for each game and calculate the power of the total games, by summing up the color multiplication.
- day 3 - Gear Ratio's
  - For part 1 you need to find all numbers adjacent to a sign and use those
  - For part 2 you need to find all numbers adjacent to * and if it is exactly 2 multiply and sum those
- day 4 - Scratch cards
  - For part 1 you need to calculate all point won of a collection of scratch cards
  - For part 2 you need to calculate how many cards you end up with after winning
