Advent of code 2024 solutions in python, using various algorithms.

## Kind of problems versus used algorithms

- day 1 - Hystorian Hysteria
    - For part 1, two list are sorted and total distance is calculated by taking the difference per pair
    - For part 2, the similarity score is calculated with the help of a counter map
- day 2 - Red nosed reports
    - For part 1, step size in list are checked on size and sign
    - For part 2, the list are also checked with one removed
- day 3 - Mull it over
    - For part 1, use a regex pattern to find all multiplications
    - For part 2, only do the multiplications when do() is before and not when don't() is before
