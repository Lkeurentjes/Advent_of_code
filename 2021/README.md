# Advent of code 2021
 Advent of code 2021 solutions in python, using various algorithms.

## Kind of problems versus used algorithms

- day 1 - Sonar Sweep
  - For part 1 you need to find out how many times the depth increases, which is done by looping over the depth and when the next is bigger, it increases the counter
  - For part 2 you need to find out how many times the sum of three depth increases, which is done by looping over the depth with use of a range and when the sums next are bigger, it increases the counter
- day 2 - Rock, Paper, Scissors
  - For Part 1 you need to calculate the total score of the game according to a strategy, this is done by making a dictionary with points for each outcome and the loop over the outcomes and translate them into scores which are summed.
  - For part 2 you need to do the same, but with a different score, so another dictionary is used
